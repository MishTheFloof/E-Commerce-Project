# E-Commerce-Project
# Project Overview
This project aims to help a clothing retail store make informed business decisions regarding its e-commerce platforms. The store offers in-store personal stylist sessions, and customers can later order their clothing selections online via either a mobile app or the website. The primary goal is to analyze customer behaviour and predict which platform (mobile app or website) the company should focus on for future improvements to maximize customer engagement and revenue.

# Dataset
The data used in this project comes from Kaggle and contains detailed customer data, including:

Customer demographics (age, gender, etc.)
In-store session details with personal stylists
Order history from both the mobile app and website
Behavioural metrics such as time spent on the platforms and purchase preferences


# Project Objectives
Predictive Model: Develop a regression model to predict future customer spending based on their platform usage and other key factors.

# Key Features
# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
The data was cleaned and prepared for analysis, including handling missing values and outliers.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Performed to understand customer behaviour and platform usage patterns.
# Correlation Analysis:
Key relationships between variables such as 'Session Length', 'Membership Length', 'Time on Platform', and 'Yearly Spending' were analyzed.
# Regression Model: 
A linear regression model was developed to predict yearly customer spending based on key predictors (e.g., session length, and platform usage).
# Model Evaluation: 
The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to ensure prediction accuracy.
# Business Insights: 
The analysis and model results were translated into business recommendations for future strategy.
# Technologies Used
Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and model building.

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and documentation.

Pandas, NumPy: For data cleaning and manipulation.

Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data visualization.

Scikit-Learn: For building and evaluating the regression model.

# Results and Conclusions
Customer Spending Insights: Analysis shows that customers who engage longer with the personal stylist during in-store sessions tend to spend more annually. However, no strong indication indicates that spending more time on the website or mobile app correlates with higher purchase amounts.


Platform Preference: The data indicates that both the mobile app and website have their unique strengths, but more frequent and higher-value purchases seem to occur through the mobile app.


Recommendation: Based on the model and analysis, the company should consider focusing on enhancing the mobile app experience as it has shown to be the more frequently used and more profitable platform. Improvements in user experience, faster checkout processes, and personalized recommendations on the mobile app could further boost customer satisfaction and spending.
